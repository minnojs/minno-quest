# Quest

The quest task activates a [minno-quest](../quest) task.
These are tasks allow you to create complex questionnaires for your experiments.
You will probably load the task from a file (use `scriptUrl`).
Note that it is almost always imperative to use the `name` property, as it is used to refer to
data gathered by the task, and to identify it in the results.

```js
{ type: 'quest', name: 'my-quest`, scriptUrl: 'my-quest.js' }
```

The API is as follows:

property        | description
--------------- | ---------------------
scriptUrl       | (String) The url of the file describing your quest task.
script          | (Object) The full task object generated by [`questAPI`](../basics/create.html)
