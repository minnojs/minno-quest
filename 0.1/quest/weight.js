//
// The weight questionnaire is a solid example of how we create a fairly complex questionnaire.
// It is heavily commented so that you can follow everything that goes on.
// After reading the documentation feel free to download the file and modify it according to your needs.
//
// ### Opening section
//
// The opening section of each script is always more or less the same.
// We create the wrapper for the script (`define`), and create a new instance of a questionnaire.
define(['questAPI'], function(Quest){

  var API = new Quest();

  // ### Creating page and questions sets
  //
  // The first thing we do in this script is create prototypes of the pages and questions that we will use.
  // Many times (usually?), questionnaires use similar settings to describe the **pages** and **questions** in their studies.
  // piQuest provides a system that allows us to prototype them so that our script may be shorter and easier to maintain
  // (it's better to make a change in one place and have it affect all your questions than having to go through each question and change it individually).
  // It's worth while to mention that it is not strictly necessary to use prototypes and inheritance,
  // you can create your pages and questions from scratch from within the [sequence](API.html#sequence).
  //
  // The prototyping system uses `API.addPagesSet` and `API.addQuestionsSet` in order to create sets of prototypical pages/questions,
  // later on we can `inherit` them into our sequence.
  // Essentially, inheritance means that we use the object that we inherit as a base for the creation of a new object
  // (see the [API](API.html#inheritance) for more details).


  // #### Page prototype
  // Here we create a prototype for the [pages](API.html#pages) in our group.
  // The prototype belongs to a group that we arbitrarily call 'basicPage', we will later use this name in order to inherit this page.
  // We will be using auto submit within the questions, so we disable the submit button for all pages (`noSubmit`).
  // And finally we add a progress bar that will track the location of the participants within the questionnaire (`progressBar`).

  /**
   * Page prototype
   */
  API.addPagesSet('basicPage',{
    noSubmit:true,
    progressBar: '<%= pagesMeta.number %> out of 15'
  });

  // Note the use of templates within the progress bar.
  // Templates are strings that have the `<%= %>` delimiters, they allow you to access environmental variables,
  // in this case we access the `pagesMeta` variable and get the current page number.
  // You can use templates anywhere you like within piQuest.
  // Both [templates](API.html#templates) and [environmental variables](API.html#variables) are fully documented within the API.


  // #### Question prototypes
  //
  // We are going to use two types of [questions](API.html#questions) throughout this questionnaire, and we'll create a prototype for each of them.
  //
  // The first question type is a simple [multiple choice input](API.html#selectone-selectmulti) (`type: 'selelctOne'`).
  // We set it to `autoSubmit` thus making the submit button redundant (autoSumit means that double clicking a response submits the page).
  // Then we request `numericValues` so that the player logs the responses to questions as numbers instead of plain text.
  // And finally we activate `help` for each of the questions and set the `helpText` for it.
  // Note the use of templates again here to return a true/false value so that the help message is shown only on the first three pages.

  /**
   * Question prototypes
   */
  API.addQuestionsSet('basicSelect',{
    type: 'selectOne',
    autoSubmit:true,
    numericValues:true,
    help: '<%= pagesMeta.number < 3 %>', // show the help message only for the first three pages
    helpText: 'Selecting an answer once colors it blue.<br/>You can change your answer by selecting another option.<br/>To confirm, click the selected (blue) button a second time.'
  });

  // The second question is a another selectOne input. This time we use the multiButtons style.
  // This is useful for questions with very many answers. Note the use of `minWidth` here, this allows us to set the width of the buttons, thus making sure they line up symmetrically.

  API.addQuestionsSet('basicDropdown',{
    type: 'selectOne',
    style: 'multiButtons',
    minWidth: '150px',
    autoSubmit:true,
    numericValues:true
  });

  // ### The Sequence
  //
  // The sequence is an ordered list of all the pages that you want to present.
  // This is where you tell piQuest how to interact with the participants.
  // The sequence is created using the `API.addSequence` function which takes a single array of pages.
  //
  // This questionnaire has several demographic/personal questions that appear at the beginning in a constant order.
  // After them we have a series of general questions that appear in a randomized order.

  API.addSequence([

    // #### Personal questions segment
    //
    // This segment has 6 demographic/personal questions.
    // They are simply listed consecutively within the sequence array.
    //
    // Each page inherits the *basicPage* prototype that we defined previously (`inherit`) and manually create the questions for it.
    // Each page has one question set into into it, inheriting either from the *basicSelect* or *basicDropdown* sets.
    // The questions each have a unique `name` set into them here as well
    // as the `stem` which is the question itself
    // and the `answers` array that holds the possible answers for multiple choice questions.
    //
    // The concept that you should keep in mind reading this code is that the inherit property extends each object with its parents properties,
    // so that each page inherits the `noSubmit` that we set into the *basicPage* prototype.

    // The sequence offers a tool for controlling the flow of pages within the sequence (or questions within a page).
    // Instead of putting pages in the sequence you may put objects called mixers that allow you to manipulate "sub sequences" in different ways.
    // In this case we will be using the `random` mixer in order to randomize a sub sequence of pages.

    //
    // ```js
    // var mixer = {
    //  mixer : 'random', // the type of mixer that we should use
    //  data : [] // the subsequence to which we apply the mixer
    // }
    // ```
    //
    // In this case we wrap the pages that with general questions within the `data` property of a `type:'random'` mixer.
